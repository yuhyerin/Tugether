    <content type="html">&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Spring community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring Web Services Samples (&lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ws-samples"&gt;spring-ws-samples&lt;/a&gt;) has been upgraded!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have known this, but many parts of this collection of samples goes all the way back to 2006. Today, I am happy to report it has been updated in a multitude of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ulist"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction to Spring Boot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction to Spring Data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removal of outdated technologies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removal of redundant samples&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a hard-won task that took me several weeks, but based on the incredible persistence of SOAP, it was something that had to be done to serve the Spring community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction-to-spring-boot"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#introduction-to-spring-boot"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Introduction to Spring Boot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest glaring things missing from this repository was an appearance of Spring Boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve been on this blog site for long, you&amp;#8217;re aware of how cool and popular Spring Boot is. These samples were created long before Spring Boot arrived, and they needed to be updated to take full advantage of the state of the art. But not because we&amp;#8217;re merely "dogfooding" our own stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring Boot introduces key concepts that any project should embrace. One of the most important is keeping up with stable, secure versions. Anytime a vulnerability is reported against the Spring portfolio, our team assesses the impact, develops a plan, rolls out the change, and informs the community so everyone can safely upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrading applications by simply bumping the version of Spring Boot is incredible. Coupled with the Spring team&amp;#8217;s dedication to backwards compatibility, you know you have a solid stack when you pick up Spring Boot, and that you won&amp;#8217;t be left in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulling all of these samples onto Spring Boot is a pivotal change that will allow us to make future updates even easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is not all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other magic of Spring Boot is a reduction in the amount of code you personally have to write. As I once said at a SpringOne conference, the code you don&amp;#8217;t write has no bugs. Being able to pitch chunks of infrastructure that are instead handled by Spring Boot is a mega-relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this must be hedged by the fact that Spring Boot doesn&amp;#8217;t have &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of Spring WS-based code in it. But it does have some bits and pieces. But that isn&amp;#8217;t the only thing at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The older version of this repository was loaded with code used to spin up servers. Essentially, DIY (Do It Yourself) variants of baking a WAR file and lauching it with Tomcat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Josh Long, a.k.a. @starbuxman, likes to say, "make JAR not WAR." By upgrading to a JAR-based approach and leaning on Spring Boot&amp;#8217;s Apache Tomcat autoconfiguration, were were able to drop any such stuff from the build system and the code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, almost everything runs on the proper version of Apache Tomcat, out-of-the-box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction-to-spring-data"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#introduction-to-spring-data"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Introduction to Spring Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;airline&lt;/strong&gt; samples were based upon a flight reservation system where you look up flights and then make your reservation request. And it used JPA to store all this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When&amp;#8217;s the last time you rolled JPA by hand? I mean, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of it. By hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By migrating toward Spring Data JPA&amp;#8217;s repository-based solution, probably around half of that custom code was scrapped in favor of interfaces with finder methods and &lt;code&gt;@Query&lt;/code&gt; -annotated methods. (See earlier comment about code you don&amp;#8217;t write!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s not just about throwing out unnecessary code. It&amp;#8217;s deeper than that. By using modern framework approaches, you also know that resources are being managed properly. Transactions are handled correctly. Data stores are better used per industry standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="removal-of-outdated-technologies"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#removal-of-outdated-technologies"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Removal of outdated technologies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of SOAP-based tools back in the early 2000s were based on Ant, which has been overtaken by Maven and Gradle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you work with a low-level build system like Ant, you find yourself spending more than a fair share of time &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; that build system. By pulling things up to Maven, with a touch of embedded Ant jobs, it&amp;#8217;s a lot easier to make project-level changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, migrating to Spring Boot 2.3.1.RELEASE exposed that the samples were running on Spring Framework 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! Talk about a blast from the past. It was nice to know that &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; operated quite smoothly when I bumped it all up to Spring Framework 5, with but one exception (a marshalling component from Apache&amp;#8217;s XML Beans that had been deprecated and removed long ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, Apache XML Beans is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; alive, but the three people probably using it &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; know how to integrate their apps together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving over to the JAXB marshaller solved that, and away we went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also able to drop OpenJPA and switch to the more popular Hibernate. Moving everything to modern day JPA + Hibernate lets us rejoin a vast community. If anyone in the community needs help, it will now be much easier for the whole community to respond on places like StackOverflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="removal-of-redundant-samples"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#removal-of-redundant-samples"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Removal of redundant samples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This update wasn&amp;#8217;t just about bumping versions. It also included assessing all the modules we had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After updating the &lt;strong&gt;airline&lt;/strong&gt; example, which includes demonstrating SAAJ, Axis1, JAX-WS, JMS, and Spring WS, it became apparent that &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; demo had multiple SOAP providers demonstrated. There are also demos that include the SOAP-based security providers as well as MTOM (Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain point, you have covered all the bases and don&amp;#8217;t need any more. And that&amp;#8217;s why the Stock Quoting demo was pulled. It didn&amp;#8217;t offer much that was different in integrating technologies together, so I pulled it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having delegated much to Spring Boot and Spring Data, the number of samples we need to upkeep slims down and makes it easier to serve the community with up-to-date, cohesive examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="introspection-on-soap-and-rest"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#introspection-on-soap-and-rest"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Introspection on SOAP and REST&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a certain irony in being both the project lead for Spring Web Services (SOAP) and a key contributor to Spring HATEOAS (REST). I&amp;#8217;ve worked with members of both communities for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working hip deep in a contract-based paradigm really highlighted (for me) the differences between SOAP and REST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SOAP is about capturing the contract that connected two systems. While it sounds nice to hammer out the details of the comm traffic between two sytems, there is a side effect. The consequence of such a well-defined and detailed contract is that the interface becomes quite brittle. The slightest change can break things, i.e. require an update to ALL parties involved. And this is something that gets magnified when your business goes international and hits modern-day scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REST on the other hand is based on system-level transitions and flexibly serving these options. With the lack of a contract, it&amp;#8217;s possible to send MORE than the user needs, offering a way to put backwards compatibility into your messaging. Users have the discretion to only consume the parts they want. And if you keep old links while offering new ones, you can achieve what is known as Postel&amp;#8217;s Law or the Robustness Principle. "Be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you accept."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve seen the success of the web, built heavily on HTML and the fact that you don&amp;#8217;t have to update your browser every time a website gets updated. There have even been studies showing that flexible APIs that are backwards compatible have an overall reduced cost to both clients and server teams, over the lifetime of the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt this lack of flexibility as I updated each and every demo. Each demo seemed to require the same effort as aligning an array of mirrors to pinpoint a laser beam. I missed the ease of creating JSON-based services combined with hypermedia. (And maybe I&amp;#8217;ll produce a video some day on this very subject!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, some systems are tied to SOAP and you need all the help you can get. Spring Web Services aims to reduce the complexity as much as is possible. And we&amp;#8217;re with you every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="we-need-your-help"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#we-need-your-help"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We need your help!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all these changes and updates, I&amp;#8217;m sure there are parts that got overlooked. Or sections that could use even more love and care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we need your help to do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you spot issues anywhere in the samples, or things you feel are way out of align, don&amp;#8217;t hesitate to &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ws-samples/issues"&gt;open a ticket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of community, this effort would not have been complete without &lt;a href="https://github.com/vanioinformatika/spring-ws-mtom-example"&gt;Gyula Szalai&lt;/a&gt;, who had grabbed a copy of our MTOM sample back in 2014, Maven-ized it, and pushed it to Github. Battling SOAP demons at 2:00 AM can be tricky. Having this working example really paved the way toward getting this release to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Greg Turnquist&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#introduction"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far in this series we have introduced the new &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/07/13/introducing-java-functions-for-spring-cloud-stream-applications-part-0"&gt;stream applications based on Java functions&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/07/20/introducing-java-functions-for-spring-cloud-stream-applications-part-1"&gt;function composition&lt;/a&gt;. We have also provided detailed examples of how to build a &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/07/27/creating-a-supplier-function-and-generating-spring-cloud-stream-source"&gt;source from a supplier&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/08/03/creating-a-function-for-consuming-data-and-generating-spring-cloud-stream-sink-applications"&gt;sink from a consumer&lt;/a&gt;.  Here we continue the journey with the first of several case studies to follow. Each case study demonstrates how to use one or more of the available pre-packaged Spring Boot stream applications, in various scenarios, to build data streaming pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we will showcase two of the most commonly used applications, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/tree/master/applications/source/http-source"&gt;HTTP source&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/tree/master/applications/sink/jdbc-sink"&gt;JDBC sink&lt;/a&gt;. We will use them to build a simple service that accepts HTTP POST requests and saves the contents to a database table.  We will first run these as standalone &lt;a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-stream"&gt;Spring Cloud Stream&lt;/a&gt; applications, and then show how to orchestrate the same pipeline with &lt;a href="https://dataflow.spring.io"&gt;Spring Cloud Data Flow&lt;/a&gt;.  This is presented as a step-by-step tutorial and we encourage you to follow the steps as you read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="preparing-the-environment"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#preparing-the-environment"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Preparing the Environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple streaming application consists of two remote processes communicating via a message broker. The pre-packaged stream applications work with either Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ out of the box. Here we will use Apache Kafka.  The JDBC sink inserts data into a database. We will use MySQL for this example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="imageblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/gh-pages/img/http-jdbc/application-schematic.png?raw=true" alt="application schematic" width="75%"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let¡¯s assume that we are starting from scratch and do not have Kafka or MySQL available in our development environment.  To run this example, we will have some fun with Docker.  So we need &lt;a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; running on our local machine. Later we will be using Spring Cloud Data Flow, so we will take advantage of the Data Flow &lt;a href="https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/installation/local/docker/"&gt;docker-compose installation&lt;/a&gt;.  This is the easiest way to get started with Data Flow. It starts up several containers, including MySQL and Kafka.  In order to make these backend services available to the standalone applications, we need to tweak the standard installation to publish ports, and change Kafka¡¯s advertised host name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonitionblock note"&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="icon"&gt;
&lt;div class="title"&gt;Note&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="content"&gt;
I have run with this setup on Mac OS, and expect that a similar setup will work on Windows.  Please leave a note in the comments section if you run into issues or have some helpful tips to share.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let¡¯s create a directory called &lt;code&gt;http-jdbc-demo&lt;/code&gt; and download &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; from github to there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget -O docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/v2.6.0/spring-cloud-dataflow-server/docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/v2.6.0/spring-cloud-dataflow-server/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to enable connections to Kafka and MySQL from the local host, we will download another bit of YAML to overlay or custom configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget -O shared-kafka-mysql.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/gh-pages/files/shared-kafka-mysql.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to obtain the LAN IP address for our local machine. On a Mac, you can do this in one of several ways, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dig +short $(hostname)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ping $(hostname)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LAN IP address is accessible to the docker containers as well, whereas &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; from inside a container refers to itself.  We need to set the environment variable &lt;code&gt;KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME&lt;/code&gt; to this value.  We also need to set a few other environment variables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;export KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME=$(dig +short $(hostname))
export DATAFLOW_VERSION=2.6.0
export SKIPPER_VERSION=2.5.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and to register the latest stream applications in Data Flow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;export STREAM_APPS_URI=https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot-local/org/springframework/cloud/stream/app/stream-applications-descriptor/2020.0.0-SNAPSHOT/stream-applications-descriptor-2020.0.0-SNAPSHOT.stream-apps-kafka-maven&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, from our project directory, we can fire up the Data Flow cluster:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f shared-kafka-mysql.yml up&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will display a lot of log messages and continue running until you terminate it (e.g., Ctrl-C), which will stop all of the containers. Keep this terminal open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open a new terminal and type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will list the running containers for the Data Flow cluster.  We will look at Data Flow later.  At this point, make sure that the &lt;code&gt;dataflow-kafka&lt;/code&gt; container shows &lt;code&gt;0.0.0.0:9092&amp;#8594;9092/tcp&lt;/code&gt; under &lt;code&gt;PORTS&lt;/code&gt;, and that &lt;code&gt;dataflow-mysql&lt;/code&gt; similarly shows &lt;code&gt;0.0.0.0:3306&amp;#8594;3306/tcp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="imageblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/gh-pages/img/http-jdbc/docker-ps.png?raw=true" alt="docker ps"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="create-a-database-table"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#create-a-database-table"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Create a database table&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could configure the JDBC sink application to initialize the database automatically, but for simplicity we will create it manually.  We can do this using any JDBC database tool or by running &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; from within the &lt;code&gt;dataflow-mysql&lt;/code&gt; container:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker exec -it dataflow-mysql mysql -uroot -p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be prompted for a password. The DB credentials are configured in &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/blob/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-server/docker-compose.yml#L22"&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/a&gt;. If you don¡¯t want to look there, the username is &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; and the password is &lt;code&gt;rootpw&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the following commands - you should be able to copy and paste the whole thing - to create a database and a table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS Demo;
USE Demo;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS People (
	 id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	 name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	 street VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	 city VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	 PRIMARY KEY (id));&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;exit;&lt;/code&gt; to exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="imageblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/gh-pages/img/http-jdbc/create-database.png?raw=true" alt="create database" width="75%"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="run-the-applications"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#run-the-applications"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Run the applications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we¡¯re ready to run the HTTP source and JDBC sink.  The Spring Boot executable jars are published to the Spring Maven repository. We need ones which are built with the Kafka binder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget https://repo.spring.io/snapshot/org/springframework/cloud/stream/app/http-source-kafka/3.0.0-SNAPSHOT/http-source-kafka-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget https://repo.spring.io/snapshot/org/springframework/cloud/stream/app/jdbc-sink-kafka/3.0.0-SNAPSHOT/jdbc-sink-kafka-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will run these in separate terminal sessions. We need to configure these apps to use the same Kafka topic, let¡¯s call it &lt;code&gt;jdbc-demo-topic&lt;/code&gt;. The Spring Cloud Stream Kafka binder will create this topic automatically.  We also need to configure the JDBC sink to connect to our  database and to map the data to the table we created.  We will post JSON that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
 ¡°name¡±:¡±My Name¡±,
 ¡°address¡±: {
      ¡°street¡±:¡±My Street¡±,
       ¡°city¡±: ¡°My City¡±
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to insert these values into the &lt;code&gt;People&lt;/code&gt; table in the &lt;code&gt;Demo&lt;/code&gt; database into the columns &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;street&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;city&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect3"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="start-the-jdbc-sink"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#start-the-jdbc-sink"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Start the JDBC Sink&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open a new terminal session where we downloaded the jars and run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;java -jar jdbc-sink-kafka-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/Demo --spring.datasource.username=root --spring.datasource.password=rootpw --jdbc.consumer.table-name=People --jdbc.consumer.columns=name,city:address.city,street:address.street --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=jdbc-demo-topic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the &lt;code&gt;jdbc.consumer.columns&lt;/code&gt; syntax for mapping the fields to the columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect3"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="start-the-http-source"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#start-the-http-source"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Start the HTTP Source&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open a new terminal session where we downloaded the jars and run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;java -jar http-source-kafka-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=9000 --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=jdbc-demo-topic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are setting the HTTP port to 9000 for the source (it&amp;#8217;s 8080 by default). Also, it is very important that the output destination of the source matches the input destination of the sink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect3"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="post-some-data"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#post-some-data"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Post some data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next,  we need to post some data to &lt;a href="http://localhost:9000"&gt;http://localhost:9000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl http://localhost:9000 -H'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"name":"My Name","address":{"street":"My Street","city":"My City"}}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect3"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="verify-the-data-has-been-saved"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#verify-the-data-has-been-saved"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Verify the data has been saved&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, find an open terminal session and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker exec -it dataflow-mysql mysql -uroot -p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Login with &lt;code&gt;rootpw&lt;/code&gt; and query the table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="imageblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/gh-pages/img/http-jdbc/query-standalone.png?raw=true" alt="query standalone" width="75%"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see this, congratulations!  The standalone Spring Cloud Stream applications are working as expected. We can terminate our standalone applications (Ctrl-C) now.  Leave the docker-compose process running so we can take a look at Data Flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="using-spring-cloud-data-flow"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#using-spring-cloud-data-flow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Using Spring Cloud Data Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, there are a lot of manual steps required to run these applications on ¡°bare metal¡±, even though we didn¡¯t have to write any code. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ulist"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;customizing the docker-compose configuration, or alternately installing kafka and mysql on the local machine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;downloading the desired versions of stream applications using a Maven URL (we just happened to know which ones to use here)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ensuring that the Spring Cloud Stream destination bindings are correctly configured so the applications can communicate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;finding and reading the &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/applications/sink/jdbc-sink/README.adoc"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; to get the configuration properties (we already did that to prepare this example ) and setting them correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;managing multiple terminal sessions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following sections we will see that doing this with &lt;a href="https://dataflow.spring.io"&gt;Spring Cloud Data Flow&lt;/a&gt; eliminates all of these steps and provides a much richer development experience overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect3"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="open-the-data-flow-dashboard"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#open-the-data-flow-dashboard"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Open the Data Flow dashboard&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, open the Data Flow Dashboard at &lt;a href="http://localhost:9393/dashboard"&gt;http://localhost:9393/dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.  This will take you to the Applications view where we see the pre-packaged applications registered. The docker-compose command we ran earlier performed this step, using a URL we provided to get the latest snapshot versions of the stream applications,  including the same jar files we just ran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="imageblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/gh-pages/img/http-jdbc/datflow-ui-applications.png?raw=true" alt="datflow ui applications"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect3"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="create-and-deploy-a-stream"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#create-and-deploy-a-stream"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Create and deploy a stream&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the dashboard, choose &lt;code&gt;Streams&lt;/code&gt; from the left menu and click on &lt;code&gt;Create Streams&lt;/code&gt; to open a graphical stream editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="imageblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/gh-pages/img/http-jdbc/dataflow-create-stream.png?raw=true" alt="dataflow create stream"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drag and drop the http source and the jdbc sink into the editor pane and use the mouse to connect the two handles. Alternatively, you can type the Data Flow stream definition DSL directly into the text box at the top:  &lt;code&gt;http | jdbc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we need to configure the applications. If you click on either one of the applications, you will see an &lt;code&gt;Options&lt;/code&gt; link. Open the options window for the JDBC sink.  You will see all the available configuration properties listed with short descriptions. The following screenshot shows a partial view; we need to scroll to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="imageblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/gh-pages/img/http-jdbc/datflow-ui-jdbc-options.png?raw=true" alt="datflow ui jdbc options" width="75%"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as before,  we need to provide the url, username, password, table, and columns.  Here, we need to change the JDBC URL to &lt;code&gt;jdbc:mariadb://mysql:3306/Demo&lt;/code&gt;,since the hostname &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to the name of the mysql service defined in &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt;. Also we set the http port to &lt;code&gt;20000&lt;/code&gt;, since it¡¯s in the configured range of published ports.  Refer to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/blob/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-server/docker-compose.yml#L82"&gt;skipper-server configuration&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="imageblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/gh-pages/img/http-jdbc/datflow-ui-stream-configured.png?raw=true" alt="]"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let¡¯s take a look at the stream definition DSL that was generated automatically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;http --port=20000 | jdbc --password=rootpw --username=root --url=jdbc:mariadb://mysql:3306/Demo --columns=name,city:address.city,street:address.street --table-name=People&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This DSL can be used in a script or a Data Flow client application to automate stream creation.  Our configuration is complete, but where are the Spring Cloud Stream destination bindings? We don¡¯t need them because Data Flow takes care of the wiring for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the &lt;code&gt;Create Stream&lt;/code&gt; button and name the stream &lt;code&gt;http-jdbc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="imageblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/gh-pages/img/http-jdbc/dataflow-ui-deploy-1.png?raw=true" alt="dataflow ui deploy 1"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deploy the stream, click on the play button:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="imageblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/gh-pages/img/http-jdbc/play-button.png?raw=true" alt="play button" width="4%"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept the default deployment properties and click &lt;code&gt;Deploy stream&lt;/code&gt; at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the &lt;code&gt;Refresh&lt;/code&gt; button as necessary. After a minute or so, you should see our stream is deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="imageblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/gh-pages/img/http-jdbc/dataflow-ui-deploy-2.png?raw=true" alt="dataflow ui deploy 2"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect3"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="post-some-data-and-verify-that-it-has-been-saved"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#post-some-data-and-verify-that-it-has-been-saved"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Post some data and verify that it has been saved&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we will post some different values to port 20000:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl http://localhost:20000 -H'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"name":"Your Name","address":{"street":"Your Street","city":"Your City"}}}'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we run the query again, we should see a new row added to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="imageblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/gh-pages/img/http-jdbc/query-dataflow.png?raw=true" alt="query dataflow" width="50%"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect3"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="data-flow-application-deployment"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#data-flow-application-deployment"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Data Flow Application Deployment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The astute reader will notice that no  Docker containers were created for the deployed applications, even though the platform itself is running in containers. In the Data Flow &lt;a href="https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/concepts/architecture/"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt;, the Skipper server is responsible for deploying stream applications. In the local  configuration, Skipper uses the Local Deployer to run jar files on its &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;, just like we did when we ran the applications standalone.  To see that this is the case, we can run &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; in the skipper container:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker exec -it skipper ps -ef&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="imageblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/gh-pages/img/http-jdbc/docker-exec-ps.png?raw=true" alt="docker exec ps"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look at the console log use the &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt; path:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker exec -it skipper more /tmp/1596916545104/http-jdbc.jdbc-v4/stdout_0.log&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;tail -f&lt;/code&gt; command also works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application logs are also viewable from the UI if the deployment is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="imageblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/gh-pages/img/http-jdbc/dataflow-ui-app-log.png?raw=true" alt="dataflow ui app log"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the deployment fails, we may need to look under the hood to troubleshoot it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonitionblock note"&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="icon"&gt;
&lt;div class="title"&gt;Note&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="content"&gt;
The local Data Flow installation is fine for local development and exploration, but we do not recommend it for production.  Production grade &lt;a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-dataflow"&gt;Spring Cloud Data Flow OSS&lt;/a&gt; , as well as commercially licensed products, are available for &lt;a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/announcing-spring-cloud-data-flow-for-kubernetes"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/scdf/1-6/index.html"&gt;Cloud Foundry&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="summary"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#summary"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just took a close look at how to build a simple data streaming pipeline from pre-packaged Spring Cloud Stream applications to save JSON content posted via HTTP to a relational database.  We used Docker and docker-compose to install a local environment and then we deployed the source and sink applications, first on ¡°bare metal¡±, and then using Spring Cloud Data Flow.  Hopefully, we learned something interesting about working with Spring Cloud Stream, Data Flow, Docker containers, the HTTP source, and JDBC sink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect3"&gt;
&lt;h4 id="stay-tuned"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#stay-tuned"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Stay Tuned&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks we will present many more case studies for Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Cloud Data Flow, each will explore different stream applications and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Spring Cloud Data Flow team is pleased to announce the release of 2.6.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 2.6.0 adds usual bug fixes and the following key highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wavefront&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; New integration to monitor streams and tasks using &lt;em&gt;Wavefront&lt;/em&gt;. More&lt;br/&gt; about this feature can be found from &lt;a href="https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/feature-guides/streams/monitoring/"&gt;Stream Monitoring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/feature-guides/batch/monitoring/"&gt;Task Monitoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platform Support for Scheduling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Tasks scheduling now have a platform support. See &lt;a href="https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/recipes/multi-platform-deployment/multi-platform-task/#scheduling-tasks"&gt;Scheduling Tasks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Java CFEnv&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We&amp;rsquo;re now on a new version of &lt;a href="https://github.com/pivotal-cf/java-cfenv"&gt;Java CFEnv&lt;/a&gt; which greatly improves user experience when there is a need to bind to user created services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitnami&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We&amp;rsquo;ve moved from a &lt;a href="https://hub.helm.sh/charts/bitnami/spring-cloud-dataflow"&gt;Helm Hub&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/spring-cloud-dataflow/helm"&gt;Bitnami&lt;/a&gt; as a helm chart storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Composed Task Runner as SCDF native module&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Composed Task Runner is now an integral part of SCDF itself and gets registered implicitly while the users who have the custom composed task runner can still override the native one. This enables us to integrate the composed tasks management within the context of Spring Cloud Data Flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stream Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is also a good reminder what&amp;rsquo;s happening on our application space by following blog series &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/07/27/creating-a-supplier-function-and-generating-spring-cloud-stream-source"&gt;Creating a Supplier Function and generating Spring Cloud Stream Source&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part 4 of the blog series in which we are introducing java functions for Spring Cloud Stream applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other parts in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/07/13/introducing-java-functions-for-spring-cloud-stream-applications-part-0"&gt;Part 1 - General Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/07/20/introducing-java-functions-for-spring-cloud-stream-applications-part-1"&gt;Part 2 - Function Composition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/07/27/creating-a-supplier-function-and-generating-spring-cloud-stream-source"&gt;Part 3 - Supplier function and Source application&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/07/27/creating-a-supplier-function-and-generating-spring-cloud-stream-source"&gt;last blog&lt;/a&gt; in this series, we saw how we can use a &lt;code&gt;java.util.function.Supplier&lt;/code&gt; to generate a Spring Cloud Stream source. In this new edition, we will see how a consuming function can be developed and tested using &lt;code&gt;java.util.function.Consumer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;java.util.function.Function&lt;/code&gt;. Later on, we will briefly explain the generation of a Spring Cloud Stream sink application from this consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="writing-a-consumer"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#writing-a-consumer"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Writing a Consumer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind writing a consumer is relatively simple. We consume data from some external source and hand it over to the business logic in the consumer. As in the case of a &lt;code&gt;Supplier&lt;/code&gt;, as we saw in the &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/07/27/creating-a-supplier-function-and-generating-spring-cloud-stream-source"&gt;previous blog&lt;/a&gt;, the action occurs inside the business logic implementation. If we use libraries to help us do all the heavy lifting such as Spring Integration, then it becomes a matter of simply delegating the data received to the library through an appropriate API. However, if there are no such libraries available, we need to write all that code by ourselves. Let¡¯s take a concrete example to demonstrate this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="writing-a-consumer-for-apache-pulsar"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#writing-a-consumer-for-apache-pulsar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Writing a Consumer for Apache Pulsar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/"&gt;Apache Pulsar&lt;/a&gt; is a popular messaging middleware system. Let¡¯s assume for a moment that we want to write a generic Java &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt; that receives data from somewhere and then forwards it to Pulsar. Without getting too much into the details , here is a trivial &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt; that accomplishes this. The basic implementation code is taken from &lt;a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/client-libraries-java/#producer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Bean
public org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Producer producer() {
  String pulsarBrokerRootUrl = "pulsar://localhost:6650";
  PulsarClient client = PulsarClient.create(pulsarBrokerRootUrl);
  String topic = "persistent://sample/standalone/ns1/my-topic";
  return client.createProducer(topic);
}

@Bean
public Consumer&amp;lt;byte[]&amp;gt; pulsarConsumer(Producer producer) {
  return payload -&amp;gt; {
     producer.send(payload);
  };
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, this is shown for illustrative purposes and may not be a complete implementation of sending data to Apache Pulsar. Nevertheless, this demonstrates the concepts that we want to convey. Looking at the consumer, we can see that the code is trivial; all we are doing inside the lambda expression is calling the &lt;code&gt;send&lt;/code&gt; method on the Apache Pulsar &lt;code&gt;Producer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can inject the above consumer into an application and invoke it¡¯s &lt;code&gt;accept&lt;/code&gt; method programmatically, providing the data. As we have seen in the previous blog, the diagram below expresses an idea of running the function standalone or as part of a data orchestration pipeline on platforms like &lt;a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-dataflow"&gt;Spring Cloud Data Flow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/gh-pages/img/stream-applications-dataflow-faas.png?raw=true" alt="Stream Applications Layered Architecture for Functions"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, that consumer was pretty straightforward, we might think to ourselves. What about if we would like to do something where things are a tad more involved? Below, we will do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="writing-a-consuming-function-for-rsocket"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#writing-a-consuming-function-for-rsocket"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Writing a consuming function for RSocket&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://rsocket.io/"&gt;RSocket&lt;/a&gt; is a bi-directional binary protocol for which Spring Framework provides excellent &lt;a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#rsocket"&gt;support&lt;/a&gt;. RSocket provides a fire and forget model, allowing  us to send messages to a RSocket server without receiving a  response. We want to write a consumer for this model using TCP where the consumer receives external data and then pushes it to the RSocket server. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-java"&gt;Java implementation&lt;/a&gt; for RSocket is based on &lt;a href="https://projectreactor.io/"&gt;Project Reactor&lt;/a&gt;.Therefore when we write a consumer we need to use  reactive types and patterns (similar to the  reactive feed supplier in the &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/07/27/creating-a-supplier-function-and-generating-spring-cloud-stream-source"&gt;previous blog&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using the fire and forget strategy, RSocket returns a &lt;code&gt;Mono&amp;lt;Void&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which our consumer needs to return from the function. However, in the case of &lt;code&gt;java.util.function.Consumer&lt;/code&gt;, we cannot return anything. Therefore we have to write a function with the signature &lt;code&gt;Function&amp;lt;String, Mono&amp;lt;Void&amp;gt;&amp;gt; rsocketConsumer()&lt;/code&gt;. Since the function returns a &lt;code&gt;Mono&amp;lt;Void&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, this is semantically equivalent to writing a consumer. The user  of the function needs to get a reference to the  &lt;code&gt;Mono&lt;/code&gt; and subscribe to it. Similar patterns are used in the out of the box consumers, we already provide for &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/functions/consumer/mongodb-consumer/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/consumer/mongo/MongoDbConsumerConfiguration.java"&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/functions/consumer/cassandra-consumer/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/consumer/cassandra/CassandraConsumerConfiguration.java"&gt;Cassandra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When setting up the project, include the following maven dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.springframework.boot&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;spring-boot-starter-rsocket&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This starter dependency from Spring Boot will transitively bring all the RSocket dependencies to our project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we write the function code, let¡¯s write a &lt;code&gt;ConfigurationProperties&lt;/code&gt; class to define some core properties that the function needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@ConfigurationProperties("rsocket.consumer")
public class RsocketConsumerProperties {

  private String host = "localhost";

  private int port = 7000;

  private String route;
¡¦
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, using  the prefix &lt;code&gt;rsocket.consumer&lt;/code&gt; , we define three properties - &lt;code&gt;host&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;port&lt;/code&gt; are for the RSocket server and &lt;code&gt;route&lt;/code&gt; is an endpoint on the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the configuration properties  , let¡¯s create a &lt;code&gt;Configuration&lt;/code&gt; class to configure  our function bean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Configuration
@EnableConfigurationProperties(RsocketConsumerProperties.class)
public class RsocketConsumerConfiguration {

  @Bean
  public Function&amp;lt;String, Mono&amp;lt;Void&amp;gt;&amp;gt; rsocketConsumer(RSocketRequester.Builder builder,
                                            RsocketConsumerProperties rsocketConsumerProperties) {
     final Mono&amp;lt;RSocketRequester&amp;gt; rSocketRequester = builder.connectTcp(rsocketConsumerProperties.getHost(),
           rsocketConsumerProperties.getPort());

     return input -&amp;gt; rSocketRequester
                 .flatMap(requester -&amp;gt; requester.route(rsocketConsumerProperties.getRoute())
                       .data(input)
                       .send());
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are injecting a builder that comes from Spring Boot auto-configuration into the function that helps us with creating an &lt;code&gt;RSocketRequester&lt;/code&gt;. Using this builder we create a &lt;code&gt;Mono&amp;lt;RSocketRequester&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with a TCP connection. The &lt;code&gt;connectTcp&lt;/code&gt; API method takes the RSocket host and port information. Once we get a handle onto &lt;code&gt;RSocketRequester&lt;/code&gt; then we use that inside the lambda provided in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call &lt;code&gt;flatMap&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;Mono&amp;lt;RSocketRequester&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and for each incoming message, we specify the &lt;code&gt;route&lt;/code&gt; and the data that needs to be sent before calling the &lt;code&gt;send&lt;/code&gt; method that ultimately pushes the data to the RSocket server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That¡¯s all it takes to write a function that consumes data and then sends it to a RSocket server using the fire and forget interaction model. Keep in mind that this code looks very simple because of the various &lt;code&gt;RSocket&lt;/code&gt; support and abstractions that Spring Framework underneath provides us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let¡¯s write a quick test to verify that the function works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we did with the reactive supplier in the previous blog, add this following dependency to the project. This helps us with testing reactive components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;io.projectreactor&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;reactor-test&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;test&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following is the test with other necessary components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@SpringBootTest(properties = {"spring.rsocket.server.port=7000", "rsocket.consumer.route=test-route"})
public class RsocketConsumerTests {

  @Autowired
  Function&amp;lt;Message&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;, Mono&amp;lt;Void&amp;gt;&amp;gt; rsocketConsumer;

  @Autowired
  TestController controller;

  @Test
  void testRsocketConsumer() {

     rsocketConsumer.apply(new GenericMessage&amp;lt;&amp;gt;("Hello RSocket"))
           .subscribe();

     StepVerifier.create(this.controller.fireForgetPayloads)
           .expectNext("Hello RSocket")
           .thenCancel()
           .verify();
  }

  @SpringBootApplication
  @ComponentScan
  static class RSocketConsumerTestApplication{}

  @Controller
  static class TestController {
     final ReplayProcessor&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; fireForgetPayloads = ReplayProcessor.create();

     @MessageMapping("test-route")
     void someMethod(String payload) {
        this.fireForgetPayloads.onNext(payload);
     }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick explanation of the testing components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ulist"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide the property &lt;code&gt;spring.rsocket.server.port&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;SpringBootApplication&lt;/code&gt;. This allows Spring Boot to auto-configure a default RSocket server for testing. Hard coding the port to &lt;code&gt;7000&lt;/code&gt; here since that is the default port used by Spring Boot when auto configuring the components. This is the same default we used in properties above.
We also specify the &lt;code&gt;route&lt;/code&gt; that we want to use in our test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;code&gt;Controller&lt;/code&gt; provided with a method annotated with &lt;code&gt;MessageMapping&lt;/code&gt; where it intercepts messages arriving at the route that we specified in the test. Each incoming record on the Server at the route is passed into a &lt;code&gt;Flux&lt;/code&gt; where it can be replayed later in the test during assertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the test, we are calling the &lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; method on the injected &lt;code&gt;RSocket&lt;/code&gt; consumer that we wrote earlier and providing it with a test message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we use a &lt;code&gt;StepVerifier&lt;/code&gt; to verify that the message was sent successfully to the &lt;code&gt;RSocket&lt;/code&gt; server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="generating-spring-cloud-stream-sink-application-from-the-rsocket-consumer"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#generating-spring-cloud-stream-sink-application-from-the-rsocket-consumer"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Generating Spring Cloud Stream Sink application from the RSocket Consumer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/07/27/creating-a-supplier-function-and-generating-spring-cloud-stream-source"&gt;last blog&lt;/a&gt;, we covered how to generate a Spring Cloud Stream source application from a Supplier function in much detail. You can follow the same patterns that we used there for generating a sink application from the RSocket function that we wrote above. We are not rehashing all the  details involved   here. Use the many different sink applications provided &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/tree/master/applications/sink"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as a template.  When we test the function with the test binder in Spring Cloud Stream, send the message to the &lt;code&gt;InputDestination&lt;/code&gt;. Spring Cloud Stream will send it downstream to the RSocket server. Then we can use the same verification strategies we used in the unit test above. See &lt;a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-stream/current/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_testing"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for more information on testing Spring Cloud Stream components using the test binder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#conclusion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we saw how we can write a plain consumer that consumes data and acts upon it, using Apache Pulsar as an example. We then explored how to develop a reactive consumer in the form of &lt;code&gt;Function&amp;lt;String, Mono&amp;lt;Void&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with RSocket fire and forget strategy to guide us. We also demonstrated how this reactive consumer can be unit tested. Please follow the procedures laid out in this article for writing your own data consumers and if you do so, consider &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/docs/Contributing.adoc"&gt;contributing&lt;/a&gt; a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="stay-tuned"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#stay-tuned"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Stay tuned¡¦?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for more deep dives and focused topics in the coming weeks. With the next blog in this series, we are starting a set of case studies in which we explore the already existing functions and applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Spring HATEOAS 1.1.1.RELEASE is out!</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Spring community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring HATEOAS &lt;code&gt;1.1.1.RELEASE&lt;/code&gt; is out, the first patched release of the latest stable line, supporting Spring Boot 2.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among many things, you&amp;#8217;ll find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ulist"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now listing community-led efforts to implement other media types. &lt;a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-hateoas/docs/1.1.1.RELEASE/reference/html/#mediatypes.community.json:api"&gt;JSON:API&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-hateoas/docs/1.1.1.RELEASE/reference/html/#mediatypes.community.siren"&gt;Siren&lt;/a&gt; are the latest. You want to add another media type? Just &lt;a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-hateoas/docs/1.1.1.RELEASE/reference/html/#mediatypes.custom"&gt;check out the details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;VndErrors&lt;/code&gt; is a media type for reporting, well, errors. And it has had a sneaky bug that crept in that we&amp;#8217;ve now patched. "logref" values are no longer confined to integers. It&amp;#8217;s important to also note that the &lt;code&gt;VndErrors&lt;/code&gt; spec is showing no signs of life, hence we&amp;#8217;ve deprecated its support. If you&amp;#8217;re starting a new hypermedia-driven project, our recommendation is to use &lt;a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-hateoas/docs/1.1.1.RELEASE/reference/html/#mediatypes.http-problem"&gt;RFC-7807&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;application/problem+json&lt;/code&gt; format&lt;/a&gt; instead. The API is more elegant and more importantly, under active development. And we&amp;#8217;ve made some fixes based on community feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are continuing to fix memory usage issues as more people crank out hypermedia links in more intense environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring HATEOS has de-lomboked the source code. This effort has been applied to the latest 1.2 and this version of 1.1 as well. (Versions predating 1.1 aren&amp;#8217;t getting backports except in very special situations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can enjoy these changes immediately if you are using Spring Boot 2.3 or higher. Simply adjust &lt;code&gt;spring-hateoas.version&lt;/code&gt; in your build file to &lt;code&gt;1.1.1.RELEASE&lt;/code&gt; and give it a spin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hateoas/milestone/51?closed=1"&gt;complete changelog on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring HATEOAS as a project has had a lot of new updates as it gets more usage in the field. Plato&amp;#8217;s famous saying, "Necessity is the mother of invention" rings true as community usage increase, exposing new ways to simplify link creation and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to stay tuned by monitoring out &lt;a href="https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-hateoas"&gt;Gitter channel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/springhateoas"&gt;following us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Spring Community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to announce the 4.7.1 release of the Spring Tools 4 for Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, and Theia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights from this release include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Spring Boot)&lt;/em&gt; enhancement: Syntax check for Annotations with Spring Expression Language (&lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/sts4/issues/475"&gt;#475&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Spring Boot)&lt;/em&gt; fixed: hard to reproduce BadLocationException inside of language server fixed now, occurred e.g. in (&lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/sts4/issues/451"&gt;#451&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Eclipse)&lt;/em&gt; new: early access update sites and distribution builds for Eclipse 2020-09 available now (and requires JDK11 to run)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Eclipse)&lt;/em&gt; improvement: old Spring Boot launch configs are now &amp;ldquo;fixed&amp;rdquo; automatically to exclude test classes again&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Eclipse)&lt;/em&gt; improvement: new Spring Symbols view now works a lot better when selecting the file scope (also takes selections from package explorer into account)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Eclipse)&lt;/em&gt; fixed: STS4 Does Not Start After Installing Papyrus Plugin (&lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/sts4/issues/499"&gt;#499&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Eclipse)&lt;/em&gt; fixed: language server now being shutdown correctly when used by new Spring Symbols view&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Eclipse)&lt;/em&gt; fixed: it is possible now to install the Spring Tools 4 into an existing Eclipse via the Spring Tools 4 p2 repo only - the main Eclipse update site doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be enabled anymore (&lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/sts4/issues/497"&gt;#497&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To download the distribution for Eclipse and find links to the marketplace entries for Visual Studio Code and Theia, please go visit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spring Tools 4: &lt;a href="https://spring.io/tools/"&gt;https://spring.io/tools/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed changes can be found here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/sts4/wiki/Changelog#2020-07-30-471-release-incl-language-servers-version-1200"&gt;https://github.com/spring-projects/sts4/wiki/Changelog#2020-07-30-471-release-incl-language-servers-version-1200&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring Tools 4.7.2 is scheduled to be released in late August 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, SBDG &lt;code&gt;1.4.0-M1&lt;/code&gt; is now available and builds on Spring Boot &lt;code&gt;2.4.0-M1&lt;/code&gt;, Spring Data &lt;code&gt;2020.0.0-M1&lt;/code&gt; (codename: &lt;em&gt;Ockham&lt;/em&gt;) and Spring Session &lt;code&gt;2020.0.0-M1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get a complete break down of all direct dependency versions in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/wiki/Spring-Boot-for-Apache-Geode-and-Pivotal-GemFire-Version-Compatibility-Matrix#version-compatibility-matrix"&gt;Version Compatibility Matrix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always you can begin any Spring Boot project using Apache Geode from &lt;a href="https://start.spring.io"&gt;start.spring.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ulist"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select your desired Spring Boot version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click "Add Dependencies"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type "Geode"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select "&lt;em&gt;Spring for Apache Geode&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click  "&lt;em&gt;GENERATE&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, the way you go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-new"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#whats-new"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What&amp;#8217;s New&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;code&gt;1.1.9.RELEASE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;1.2.9.RELEASE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;1.4.0-M1&lt;/code&gt; releases were primarily focused on aligning with dependencies and picking up new bits, the SBDG &lt;code&gt;1.3.1.RELEASE&lt;/code&gt; rounds out the &lt;em&gt;Import/Export&lt;/em&gt; functionality in &lt;a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot-data-geode-build/1.3.x/reference/html5/#geode-data-using"&gt;Using Data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like Spring Boot&amp;#8217;s support for &lt;a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto-initialize-a-database-using-spring-jdbc"&gt;SQL database initialization&lt;/a&gt;, SBDG allows you to place 1 or more JSON files on the application classpath to load GemFire/Geode Regions with data on startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Spring Boot, SBDB allows you to subsequently &lt;a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot-data-geode-build/1.3.x/reference/html5/#geode-data-using-export"&gt;export data&lt;/a&gt; from your Regions when the Spring Boot application is shutdown. This is convenient if you want to move data from QA to DEV in order to reproduce and debug an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;1.3.1.RELEASE&lt;/code&gt;, SBDG further delineates the primary concerns of importing and exporting data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ulist"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Format (e.g. JSON vs. XML vs. other)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resource Resolution (e.g. classpath, filesystem, URL)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resource Reading/Writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, SBDG imports JSON from the classpath and exports JSON to the filesystem.  However, with each of the concerns above broken out, you could import JSON from a Web Service and export XML to an FTP site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see an example of changing the Resource Resolution, Reading, and Writing strategies, see the &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/blob/master/spring-geode-autoconfigure/src/test/java/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/data/RestServiceCacheDataImportExportIntegrationTests.java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;RestServiceCacheDataImportExportIntegrationTests&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; test class in SBDG&amp;#8217;s test suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more in the &lt;a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot-data-geode-build/1.3.x/reference/html5/#geode-data-using-import-export-api-extensions"&gt;reference documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, SBDG &lt;code&gt;1.3.1.RELEASE&lt;/code&gt; (and &lt;code&gt;1.4.0-M1&lt;/code&gt;) pulls in &lt;em&gt;Spring Test for Apache Geode &amp;amp; VMware GemFire&lt;/em&gt; (STDG) &lt;code&gt;0.0.17.RELEASE&lt;/code&gt;, which includes a few new notable additions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ulist"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-test-data-geode#mock-object-scope&amp;#8212;&amp;#8203;lifecycle-management"&gt;How-To&lt;/a&gt; control the GemFire/Geode mock objects scope and lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-test-data-geode#mocking-unsupported-region-operations"&gt;How-To&lt;/a&gt; mock additional, GemFire/Geode mock object operations (e.g. &lt;code&gt;Region.putIfAbsent(key, value)&lt;/code&gt;) not supported by STDG, OOTB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-test-data-geode#cleaning-up-after-gemfiregeode-during-integration-tests"&gt;How-To&lt;/a&gt; perform GemFire/Geode resource and artifact cleanup when &lt;em&gt;Integration Testing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use STDG in your Spring Boot application when &lt;em&gt;Unit or Integration Testing&lt;/em&gt; with either Apache Geode or VMware, simply add &lt;code&gt;org.springframework.geode:spring-geode-starter-test&lt;/code&gt; to your test compile classpath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-next"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#whats-next"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What&amp;#8217;s Next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;1.3.2.RELEASE&lt;/code&gt; (tentatively &lt;a href="https://spring-calendar.cfapps.io/"&gt;scheduled&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;Thurs, Aug 6th&lt;/strong&gt;) we plan to improve on the documentation with more details on how to use security (Auth, TLS) in your Spring Boot applications with Apache Geode or VMware GemFire.  See and follow &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/pull/81"&gt;PR #81&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the SBDG &lt;code&gt;1.4&lt;/code&gt; release line, the focus will be on adding support for Async (i.e. &lt;em&gt;Write Behind&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;em&gt;Inline Caching&lt;/em&gt; capabilities on top of the existing &lt;a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot-data-geode-build/1.3.x/reference/html5/#geode-caching-provider-inline-caching"&gt;synchronous (&lt;em&gt;Read/Write Through&lt;/em&gt;) Inline Caching&lt;/a&gt; capabilities, present today.  See and follow &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/issues/58"&gt;Issue #58&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#conclusion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, any feedback is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/issues"&gt;Issues&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/pulls"&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-boot"&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="#release" class="anchor" name="release"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;RELEASE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the community, I am pleased to announce that the Milestone 3 (M3) of the &lt;a href="https://cloud.spring.io"&gt;Spring Cloud 2020.0&lt;/a&gt; Release Train (code name &lt;code&gt;Ilford&lt;/code&gt;) is available today. The release can be found in &lt;a href="https://repo.spring.io/milestone/"&gt;Spring Milestone&lt;/a&gt; repository. You can check out the 2020.0 &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-cloud/wiki/Spring-Cloud-2020.0-Release-Notes"&gt;release notes for more information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="#notable-changes-in-the-2020-0-release-train" class="anchor" name="notable-changes-in-the-2020-0-release-train"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Notable Changes in the 2020.0 Release Train&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release requires Spring Boot 2.4.0-M1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See all of the included issues and pull requests at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/spring-cloud/projects/42"&gt;Github project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#spring-cloud-sleuth" class="anchor" name="spring-cloud-sleuth"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Cloud Sleuth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improvement with Reactor integration &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/issues/1682"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integration with Spring Cloud Function&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integration with MongoDB &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/issues/1625"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#spring-cloud-kubernetes" class="anchor" name="spring-cloud-kubernetes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Cloud Kubernetes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is now possible to refresh application configuration when values change in ConfigMaps or Secrets without relying on the Kubernetes API. See &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-kubernetes/pull/567"&gt;#567&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improvement to maintain the data types and definition order of properties bound to java.util.Map. See &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-kubernetes/pull/554"&gt;#554&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#spring-cloud-consul" class="anchor" name="spring-cloud-consul"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Cloud Consul&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adds support for non-String payload types in Consul Bus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#spring-cloud-config" class="anchor" name="spring-cloud-config"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Cloud Config&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JDBC Environment Repository may now be disabled with a property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#spring-cloud-function" class="anchor" name="spring-cloud-function"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Cloud Function&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from few enhancements and bug fixes this release includes initial support for RSocket integration. A separate blog post will follow shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#spring-cloud-gateway" class="anchor" name="spring-cloud-gateway"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Cloud Gateway&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the ability to trip a circuit breaker based on returned status code. See &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway/pull/1836"&gt;#1836&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#spring-cloud-contract" class="anchor" name="spring-cloud-contract"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Cloud Contract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upgrading WireMock to 2.27.0 &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/issues/1440"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aligning Rest Assured version with Boot &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/issues/1431"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Numerous library upgrades &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/issues?q=label%3Adependencies+milestone%3A3.0.0-M3"&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#spring-cloud-commons" class="anchor" name="spring-cloud-commons"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Cloud Commons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spring Cloud Loadbalancer lifecycle has been &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-commons/pull/733"&gt;completed&lt;/a&gt;. This allows users to easily react to Load Balancer lifecycle events in a type-safe manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#spring-cloud-openfeign" class="anchor" name="spring-cloud-openfeign"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Cloud Openfeign&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adds support for OpenFeign Collection Format &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-openfeign/pull/371."&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#spring-cloud-stream" class="anchor" name="spring-cloud-stream"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Cloud Stream&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tighter integration with Spring Cloud Function, few new features in TestBinder allowing you to send to and receive from a named destination(s), significant performance improvements for dynamic destinations, as well as numerous enhancements and bug fixes across the framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="#spring-cloud-task" class="anchor" name="spring-cloud-task"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Cloud Task&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring Cloud Task has added &lt;code&gt;JdbcCursorItemReader&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;JdbcItemWriter&lt;/code&gt; to the Starter for Single-step Batch Jobs feature. This feature allows a user to configure a single-step Spring Batch job through properties alone. An example on how to use this feature can be found in &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/05/11/spring-cloud-task-2-3-0-m1-is-now-available"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;

    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Spring Cloud Consul &lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Spring Cloud Function &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3.1.0-M2 &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Spring Cloud Gateway &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part 3 of the blog series in which we are introducing java functions for Spring Cloud Stream applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other parts in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/07/13/introducing-java-functions-for-spring-cloud-stream-applications-part-0"&gt;Part 1 - General Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/07/20/introducing-java-functions-for-spring-cloud-stream-applications-part-1"&gt;Part 2 - Function Composition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two blogs in this series, we provided a &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/07/13/introducing-java-functions-for-spring-cloud-stream-applications-part-0"&gt;general introduction&lt;/a&gt; to this new initiative of migrating all the existing &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters"&gt;Spring Cloud Stream App Starters&lt;/a&gt; to functions and the various ways in which we can &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/07/20/introducing-java-functions-for-spring-cloud-stream-applications-part-1"&gt;compose them&lt;/a&gt;. In this blog, we continue the series, showing how these functions are developed, tested, and used to generate Spring Cloud Stream applications. In particular, here we are focusing on how to write a supplier function (implementing &lt;code&gt;java.util.function.Supplier&lt;/code&gt;)  and then generate the corresponding source application for Spring Cloud Stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="writing-a-new-supplier"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#writing-a-new-supplier"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Writing a new supplier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to drive the concept home, we are going to take a use case and implement a solution to satisfy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="use-case"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#use-case"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Use case&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need a function, when invoked with the right configuration that gives us the contents of a blog feed in the format of atom, rss, etc.  We need to support two supplier invocation models - one in which we invoke the function programmatically (for example, a REST endpoint that is invoked in a FaaS environment) and the other is a streaming supplier in which we get a constant flow of feeds as soon as they become available. We want to build these suppliers based on the &lt;a href="https://rometools.github.io/rome/index.html"&gt;ROME library&lt;/a&gt; , a popular library for feed aggregation. We will look at this from the perspective of both Non Spring Developers and Spring Developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="non-spring-developers"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#non-spring-developers"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Non Spring Developers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us assume for a second that you are not a Spring developer and not familiar with
Spring Integration which
 already provides abstractions for
 ROME. In that case, we can certainly use ROME directly to produce feed records. For example, this is a valid Supplier for this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public Supplier&amp;lt;SyndEntry&amp;gt; feedSupplier()
{
	return () -&amp;gt; {
		//Use the ROME framework directly to produce syndicated entries.
	}
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit here is that we can develop the supplier without any knowledge of Spring, and it can be deployed to a serverless environment directly, using the abstractions provided by that environment or by relying on a framework like Spring Cloud Function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essentially means that if you are a Java developer without much Spring Framework skills, you can still write the functions using just the interfaces defined in the &lt;code&gt;java.util.function&lt;/code&gt; package such as &lt;code&gt;Function&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Supplier&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt;, by providing the business logic. Then we can take this artifact that we developed and transform it into a Spring Cloud Stream application by adding a Spring Cloud Stream binder dependency and making it into a &lt;code&gt;SpringBootApplication&lt;/code&gt;. By providing a few configuration properties like the middleware destinations, we get the immediate value add of deploying the application on a platform like &lt;a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-dataflow"&gt;Spring Cloud Data Flow&lt;/a&gt; which orchestrates the application as part of a  data pipeline. This way, we write the functions completely independent of any Spring dependencies and only bring Spring components like Spring Cloud Stream, Spring Cloud Function and Spring Cloud Data Flow etc. toward the end of the deployment journey. The following diagram captures this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/gh-pages/img/stream-applications-dataflow-faas.png?raw=true" alt="Stream Applications Layered Architecture for Functions"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can observe, the function components can be invoked standalone or as part of the Spring Cloud Data Flow pipeline after making it a Spring Cloud Stream application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="spring-developers"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#spring-developers"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spring Developers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the above model is probably a good starting point, as we start diving into directly using the ROME framework, we might quickly realize that it involves a lot of heavy lifting and deeper library knowledge. Chances of making mistakes are high, so we need to write a lot of tests to verify that our custom implementation works as expected,  and that all the corner cases are covered. We start to wonder if there is already some simpler abstraction available. That way we don¡¯t need to write any ROME specific code as the abstraction layer takes care of all the intricacies. Luckily we have a solution. &lt;a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-integration"&gt;Spring Integration&lt;/a&gt; provides a lot of inbound and outbound adapters for many enterprise technologies. The &lt;a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/feed.html"&gt;feed adapter&lt;/a&gt; is one of them and the implementation is based on ROME. As a matter of fact, many of the function components that we provide in pre-packaged &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications"&gt;stream-applications&lt;/a&gt;, are based on Spring Integration adapters. These adapters have been widely used and heavily battle tested for a vast number of enterprise use cases. However, there is a chance that the technology for which we  want to write a supplier is not available in Spring Integration. In that case, as we have seen above,  we can certainly write the code on our own and invoke it from the supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="using-the-spring-integration-feed-adapter-in-the-supplier"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#using-the-spring-integration-feed-adapter-in-the-supplier"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Using the Spring Integration Feed adapter in the supplier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven¡¯t done so,  fork and clone the &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications"&gt;stream applications repo&lt;/a&gt;. Then create a new &lt;code&gt;feed-supplier&lt;/code&gt; module under &lt;code&gt;functions/supplier&lt;/code&gt;.  Use one of the existing suppliers as a template to guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the following Spring Integration Feed adapter dependency in the project. This brings the feed adapter from Spring Integration as well as any other transitive dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.springframework.integration&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;spring-integration-feed&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="adding-basic-configuration-properties"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#adding-basic-configuration-properties"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Adding basic configuration properties&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have our core dependency in, let¡¯s start writing some code. Since the functions are expected to be used in a Spring Boot context, we need to create a &lt;code&gt;ConfigurationProperties&lt;/code&gt; class to drive the configuration for the supplier function. Here is what it might look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;package org.springframework.cloud.fn.supplier.feed;

@ConfigurationProperties("feed.supplier")
public class FeedSupplierProperties {

/**
* Key used in metadata store to avoid duplicate read from the feed
*/
private String metadataKey;

/**
* Feed url.
*/
private URL feedUrl;

// rest is omitted
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, we use the prefix of &lt;code&gt;feed.supplier&lt;/code&gt; on all the properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="adding-the-configuration-class"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#adding-the-configuration-class"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Adding the Configuration class&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, let&amp;#8217;s create a Spring based configuration class where we provide all the necessary components. We will build it incrementally. Below is the basic structure of the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;package org.springframework.cloud.fn.supplier.feed;
...
@Configuration
@EnableConfigurationProperties(FeedSupplierProperties.class)
public class FeedSupplierConfiguration {

}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add these fields to the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;private final ConcurrentMetadataStore metadataStore;

private final Resource resource;

private final FeedSupplierProperties feedSuppplierProperties;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick note on these fields. Feed adapter in Spring Integration provides a capability for not reading the same entries that we read from a feed already.  The &lt;code&gt;metadataKey&lt;/code&gt; property we defined above is used for this purpose. The way it does is by using a metadata store. There are &lt;a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/docs/current/reference/html/system-management.html#metadata-store"&gt;various metadata stores available&lt;/a&gt; for popular databases. Include the following dependency for an in-memory simple metadata store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.springframework.cloud.fn&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;metadata-store-common&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${project.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this requirement is specific to this supplier and not all suppliers may need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can provide a &lt;code&gt;Resource&lt;/code&gt; bean for reading the feed if there is no HTTP (or HTTPS) based url available (which we can set through the configuration property).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s add a constructor to use these fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FeedSupplierConfiguration(FeedSupplierProperties feedSupplierProperties,
                   ConcurrentMetadataStore metadataStore,
                   @Nullable Resource resource) {
  this.feedSuppplierProperties = feedSupplierProperties;
  this.metadataStore = metadataStore;
  this.resource = resource;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Resource&lt;/code&gt; is nullable because most often we can simply pass the URL string as a configuration property and not provide a &lt;code&gt;Resource&lt;/code&gt; bean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spring Integration Feed adapter provides &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration/blob/master/spring-integration-feed/src/main/java/org/springframework/integration/feed/inbound/FeedEntryMessageSource.java"&gt;FeedEntryMessageSource&lt;/a&gt;  which is a &lt;code&gt;MessageSource&lt;/code&gt; implementation. We will use this message source in our supplier. Let¡¯s set it up as a Spring Bean.The code below is pretty self explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Bean
public FeedEntryMessageSource feedEntryMessageSource() {
  final FeedEntryMessageSource feedEntryMessageSource = this.resource == null ? new FeedEntryMessageSource(this.feedSuppplierProperties.getFeedUrl(),
        this.feedSuppplierProperties.getMetadataKey()) :
       ...
  return feedEntryMessageSource;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="non-reactive-supplier"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#non-reactive-supplier"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Non Reactive Supplier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the MessageSource bean ready, it is relatively trivial to  write a simple Supplier and invoke it programmatically by calling the &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; method of the supplier. Here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Bean
public Supplier&amp;lt;Message&amp;lt;SyndEntry&amp;gt;&amp;gt; feedSupplier() {
  return () -&amp;gt; feedEntryMessageSource().receive();
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can inject this Supplier bean into our application and call the &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; method programmatically. When this &lt;code&gt;Supplier&lt;/code&gt; is used in a Spring Cloud Stream application (as we will see later), it will use a &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/master/spring-cloud-stream/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/stream/config/DefaultPollerProperties.java"&gt;default poller&lt;/a&gt; provided by Spring Cloud Stream that will trigger the supplier every second by default. This schedule can be changed in the poller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="reactive-supplier"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#reactive-supplier"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Reactive Supplier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The non reactive polling solution looks alright, but we might ask, how about if I don¡¯t want to poll explicitly every so often, but I want the data as soon as it is available in the message source in a streaming manner? Well, we have a solution for that - develop a reactive supplier that delivers the data received as soon as it becomes available. Let¡¯s see the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here again, Spring Integration provides some abstractions we can use to  convert our &lt;code&gt;FeedEntryMessageSource&lt;/code&gt; into a reactive publisher as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Bean
public Supplier&amp;lt;Flux&amp;lt;Message&amp;lt;SyndEntry&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; feedSupplier() {
  return () -&amp;gt; IntegrationReactiveUtils.messageSourceToFlux(feedEntryMessageSource());
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may notice that this supplier returns a &lt;code&gt;Flux&amp;lt;Message&amp;lt;SyndEntry&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;  as opposed to &lt;code&gt;Message&amp;lt;SyndEntry&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as shown in the initial non-reactive supplier in which we were relying on programmatic invocation of the supplier or some other polling mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="other-reactive-solutions"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#other-reactive-solutions"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Other Reactive Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, it was nice that we had a &lt;code&gt;MessageSource&lt;/code&gt; coming from Spring Integration and we could use that utility method for converting it to a &lt;code&gt;Flux&lt;/code&gt;. What if there was no such &lt;code&gt;MessageSource&lt;/code&gt; and we had to hand craft the basic retrieval of the data for the systems for which  we want to write a reactive style supplier? For those cases, we can use the various facilities provided by &lt;a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#processors"&gt;Project Reactor&lt;/a&gt; and then programmatically feed the data to them. The bottom line is that, when we write a reactive streaming supplier, we have to return the data as a &lt;code&gt;Flux&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="unit-testing-the-reactive-supplier"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#unit-testing-the-reactive-supplier"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Unit Testing the Reactive Supplier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let¡¯s add a unit test for this reactive supplier. We can use the atom feed example described in &lt;a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287"&gt;RFC 4287 - The Atom Syndication Format&lt;/a&gt; as our test data. Include it in &lt;code&gt;src/test/resources&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the test class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@SpringBootTest(properties = {"feed.supplier.feedUrl=classpath:atom.xml",
     "feed.supplier.metadataKey=feedTest" })
@DirtiesContext
public class FeedSupplierTests {

  @Autowired
  Supplier&amp;lt;Flux&amp;lt;Message&amp;lt;SyndEntry&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; feedSupplier;

  @Test
  public void testFromSampleRssFile() {
     final Flux&amp;lt;Message&amp;lt;SyndEntry&amp;gt;&amp;gt; messageFlux = feedSupplier.get();

     StepVerifier.create(messageFlux)
           .assertNext((message) -&amp;gt; {
              assertThat(message.getPayload().getTitle().trim()).isEqualTo("Atom draft-07 snapshot");
              assertThat(message.getPayload().getContents().size()).isEqualTo(1);
              assertThat(message.getPayload().getContents().get(0).getValue().contains("The Atom draft is finished.")).isTrue();
           })
           .thenCancel()
           .verify();
  }

  @SpringBootApplication
  static class FeedSupplierTestApplication {

  }

}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="adding-the-supplier-function-to-the-maven-bom-for-functions"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#adding-the-supplier-function-to-the-maven-bom-for-functions"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Adding the Supplier function to the maven BOM for functions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functions project aggregates all the available functions in a &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/functions/function-dependencies/pom.xml"&gt;maven BOM&lt;/a&gt;. Add the &lt;code&gt;feed-supplier&lt;/code&gt; to this BOM. This is primarily needed, if you are generating the Spring Cloud Stream application based on this function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="generating-spring-cloud-stream-applications-from-the-supplier"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#generating-spring-cloud-stream-applications-from-the-supplier"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Generating Spring Cloud Stream Applications from the Supplier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in the process, we can submit a pull request to the repository with our supplier, but if we want to generate Spring Cloud Stream binder based applications from the supplier, keep on reading. Once generated, these applications can be run standalone or as part of a data orchestration pipeline in &lt;a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-dataflow"&gt;Spring Cloud Data Flow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and create a new module called &lt;code&gt;feed-source&lt;/code&gt; under &lt;code&gt;applications/source&lt;/code&gt;. As we have mentioned in the previous blogs, &lt;code&gt;java.util.function.Supplier&lt;/code&gt; is mapped as a Spring Cloud Stream Source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don¡¯t need to add any custom code on top of our feed supplier as it can be used as it is. However, now that we are talking about Spring Cloud Stream application, we need to use the &lt;a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-stream/3.0.6.RELEASE/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_testing"&gt;test binder&lt;/a&gt; with the supplier function to see how the supplier works with Spring Cloud Stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use one of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/tree/master/applications/source"&gt;existing sources&lt;/a&gt; as a template to guide us through the process. We can even copy one of them and make changes incrementally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the apps use the  parent pom &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/tree/master/applications/stream-applications-core"&gt;stream-applications-core&lt;/a&gt; which brings all the necessary test dependencies, like the test binder mentioned above. It also provides the infrastructure for the application generator plugin that is responsible for generating the binder based applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One point that we would like to emphasize is that unless the application module contains custom code, this module simply becomes an application generator that generates the binder based applications. In other words, we won¡¯t add a class with &lt;code&gt;@SpringBootApplicaiton&lt;/code&gt; to it, rather it is generated for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="testing-the-supplier-with-the-test-binder"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#testing-the-supplier-with-the-test-binder"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Testing the supplier with the test binder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the following dependency for testing with test binder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;dependencies&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.springframework.cloud.fn&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;feed-supplier&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;test&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dependencies&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can add a test to verify that the &lt;code&gt;feed-supplier&lt;/code&gt; works with the test binder in Spring Cloud Stream. Basically, we need to ensure that the supplier produces the data through the test binder and it is delivered to the destination on the test binder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the general idea behind the test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;public class FeedSourceTests {

  @Test
  public void testFileSource() throws Exception {
     try (ConfigurableApplicationContext context = new SpringApplicationBuilder(
           TestChannelBinderConfiguration
                 .getCompleteConfiguration(FeedSourceTestApplication.class))
           .web(WebApplicationType.NONE)
           .run("--spring.cloud.function.definition=feedSupplier", "--feed.supplier.feedUrl=classpath:atom.xml", "--feed.supplier.metadataKey=feedTest")) {

        OutputDestination target = context.getBean(OutputDestination.class);
        Message&amp;lt;byte[]&amp;gt; sourceMessage = target.receive(10000);
        Object title = JsonPath.parse(new String(sourceMessage.getPayload())).read("$.title");
        assertThat(title).isEqualTo("Atom draft-07 snapshot");
     }
  }

  @SpringBootApplication
  @Import(FeedSupplierConfiguration.class)
  public static class FeedSourceTestApplication {

  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test is largely similar to the unit test we added for the supplier, but with a big difference. In the supplier, we were directly invoking it and verifying the data produced. Here, we are not invoking the supplier directly, but the binding mechanism in Spring Cloud Stream does that for us automatically. We are receiving the data from the outbound destination and then verify that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the test passes, it is time for us to generate the applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="generating-the-binder-based-applications"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#generating-the-binder-based-applications"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Generating the binder based applications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, the plugin generates applications for both Kafka and Rabbit binders in Spring Cloud Stream. This is configured in the parent pom in &lt;code&gt;stream-applications-core&lt;/code&gt;. If we have a need to customize the generation for different binders, we need to make those changes there. Below is the configuration for the application generator plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="listingblock"&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;
&lt;pre class="prettyprint highlight"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.springframework.cloud.stream.app.plugin&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;spring-cloud-stream-app-maven-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;generatedApp&amp;gt;
           &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;feed&amp;lt;/name&amp;gt;
           &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;source&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;
           &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${project.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
           &amp;lt;configClass&amp;gt;org.springframework.cloud.fn.supplier.feed.FeedSupplierConfiguration.class&amp;lt;/configClass&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;/generatedApp&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;dependencies&amp;gt;
           &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.springframework.cloud.fn&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;feed-supplier&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
           &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;
           &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.springframework.cloud.stream.app&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;stream-applications-composite-function-support&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${stream-apps-core.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
           &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;/dependencies&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let¡¯s quickly go over some details here. We are requesting the plugin to create an application with the name &lt;code&gt;feed-source&lt;/code&gt; and want it to use our &lt;code&gt;Supplier&lt;/code&gt; developed above as the main configuration class. Within the dependencies section for the plugin, we also need to add any dependencies that the app needs, &lt;code&gt;feed-supplier&lt;/code&gt; in this case. We need to add all our processor functions in all the generated source applications. This is because we can compose the source with other processors without requiring them to run as individual microservices as we have seen in the &lt;a href="https://spring.io/blog/2020/07/20/introducing-java-functions-for-spring-cloud-stream-applications-part-1"&gt;previous blog&lt;/a&gt;. More details on function composition with the processors can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/docs/FunctionComposition.adoc"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as well. This is why we are adding the dependency, &lt;code&gt;stream-applications-composite-function-support&lt;/code&gt; in the dependencies section in the plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build the application module and we will see the binder based apps in the &lt;code&gt;apps&lt;/code&gt; folder.
They will be named as &lt;code&gt;feed-source-kafka&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;feed-source-rabbit&lt;/code&gt;. We can go to either of those applications and build it and then use it as a standalone application or as part of a pipeline on Spring Cloud Data Flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#conclusion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Conclusion.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we saw the entire process of of developing, testing and contributing a combination of supplier/Spring Cloud Stream application. Please follow the procedures laid out here for writing your own suppliers and sources. If you have done so, please consider contributing them back to the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect2"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="stay-tuned"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#stay-tuned"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Stay tuned¡¦?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is the third in a series that will cover many related topics. Look for more deep dives and focused topics in the coming weeks. In the next blog in this series, similar to what we did in this post about writing a new Supplier and Source, we will write a Consumer function and then generate a Sink application from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Spring community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the team and everyone who contributed, it is my pleasure to announce a number of maintenance releases for Spring Integration. Mostly these versions contain bug fixes and dependency upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sect1"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cve-2020-5413"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#cve-2020-5413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;CVE-2020-5413&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spring Integration framework provides Kryo &lt;code&gt;Codec&lt;/code&gt; implementations as an alternative for Java (de)serialization. When &lt;code&gt;Kryo&lt;/code&gt; is configured with default options, all unregistered classes are resolved on demand. This leads to the "deserialization gadgets" exploit when the incoming data contains malicious code for execution during deserialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to protect against this type of attack, &lt;code&gt;Kryo&lt;/code&gt; can be configured to require a set of trusted classes for (de)serialization. Spring Integration calls &lt;code&gt;kryo.setRegistrationRequired(true);&lt;/code&gt; (trust no one) by default  and pre-configures out-of-the-box &lt;code&gt;Message&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; implementations as trusted classes. All other types have to be registered with &lt;code&gt;Kryo&lt;/code&gt; using any available &lt;code&gt;KryoRegistrar&lt;/code&gt; strategy injected into a &lt;code&gt;PojoCodec&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit: ChengGao, ZeZhiLin, Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Security Team &lt;a href="https://www.aliyun.com/" class="bare"&gt;https://www.aliyun.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the mentioned Spring Integration versions include the fix for this CVE; everybody who&amp;#8217;s using Kryo support in Spring Integration is encouraged to upgrade respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
